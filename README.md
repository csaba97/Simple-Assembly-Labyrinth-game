### About  
[Check out this short video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/6cYuaGuCNRI)   
The game: the game starts by asking the user to press `ENTER`. Until the user presses `Enter`, nothing happens. When the user presses `ENTER`, time starts ticking and the user has to finish the 1st level. When the user finishes the 1st level, the maze changes to the second one and so on…….After the user finishes all the levels, a `CONGRATULATIONS` message will appear on the screen in a fancy message box. The score of the current game and the highscore will be also shown on the screen. Another message will be shown to the user: `Do you want to restart the game(y/n)`. If the user presses `y` then the game will be restarted, else if the user presses `n` then the game will end. Nothing happens for other buttons. During the game, if the user doesn’t want to finish the game, he/she simply presses button `ESC` and the game will end.
